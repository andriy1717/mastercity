City Rebuilders v7 — Upgrade Edition (LAN)
==========================================
Rules:
- Gathering: any resource uses **1 AP**, yields differ. Turn auto-ends at 0 AP.
- Upgrade: buildings are unique; **+10% yield per level** (Lv1→Lv10). Linear success: 100%,90%,...,10%. **5% critical** gives +2 levels.
- Build: **resources only** (0 AP). You own each building once.
- Trade: **0 AP** with bank-favorable prices; coins are scarcer and more valuable.
- Ages: advance automatically when you own **≥2 buildings of your current age**.
- Events: rare good/bad events (~8%/turn).
